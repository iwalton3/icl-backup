# icl-backup

ICL-Backup allows you to back up computers incrementally. The software will back up Linux and Windows machines, even if UEFI Secure Boot is used. Backups are saved to an external hard drive, which can be encrypted to safely store backups. The tool offers support for backing up LVM and LUKS partitions intelligently.
